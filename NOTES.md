# Notes
Things I learned along the way. I'll try to keep it organized alphabetically.

## A more helpful REPL
[croissant](https://github.com/giann/croissant)!
This is really helpful as it provides autocompletion, syntax coloring, a debugger, and more!

## Printing contents of a table
```lua
for k,v in pairs(t) do
    print(k, v)
end
```

## The Lua package manager
[LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/)!
Basic install usage: `luarocks install <package>`

## Where's the manual
[5.4 manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/)
